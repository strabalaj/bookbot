# bookbot
BookBot is my first project with boot.dev! 
Language: Python 3.12.3

In this project I took in a large file and created functions to perform the following tasks:
- open the entire book in the terminal window
- count the total number of words in the document
- count the total number of letters in the document and store information in a dictionary
- generate an informative report to user with information found during tests.
